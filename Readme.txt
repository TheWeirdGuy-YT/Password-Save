# Password-Save
This is a Python Script to keep your Passwords Save... ItÂ´s like Pin Save, but in Python...

Instructions:
How to set up your Password to access the Passwords and information:

In line 8, you find this peace of code:
    "if password_info == "**Password**":"

To set your Password, you have to edit the Thicc marked Text **Password** and replace it with your own Password.
For Example:
"if password_info == "12345678":" will change the Password to **12345678**.
"if password_info == "ThisIsWorthTheStar":" will change it to **ThisIsWorthTheStar**.
Heck, you can even do "if password_info == "**@##@ab#**":" and it should Still work unless there is a Syntax error...


How to add your information:

There are 4 Lines Prewritten:
    print ("Wifi Password:  Password here")
    print ("Credit Card:    Password here")
    print ("Email Address:  ???@???.???")
    print ("Email Password: Password here")
    
To add information, you just swap out the Parts in the ("") Area...
Example:
    print ("Wifi Password:  a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j0")
    print ("Credit Card:    1234")
    print ("Email Address:  example@abc.com/de/org")
    print ("Email Password: MyPasswordIsSave")
    
If you want to add more Information, you can allways add another line...
This would look like this then:
    print ("Wifi Password:  a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j0")
    print ("Credit Card:    1234")
    print ("Email Address:  example@abc.com/de/org")
    print ("Email Password: MyPasswordIsSave")
    print ("Another Information: Information")

I just want to say that this is my first Python script ever and i worked really hard on it!!! I even went as far as watching a Tutorial from a Slav... And no, this Script is not Blin powerd... 
Please have Fun with it...
